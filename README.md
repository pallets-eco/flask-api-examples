# Flask API Examples

A collection of web API example applications built with Flask and Flask extensions/frameworks.


## Installation

Get the code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-api-examples.git
$ cd flask-api-examples
```

Create & activate a virtual environment:

For macOS/Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```
> python -m venv env
> env\Scripts\activate
```

Each example stores in different folders. For example, the pure Flask example is in
the `flask` folder. To run this example, change into that folder:

```
$ cd flask
```

Then install the requirements and run the application:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask run
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Read the `README.md` in the sub folder for more details of the specific Flask extensions/frameworks.
